## About Me

I'm Ronald, a Computer Science student at Chandigarh University.  
Currently learning full-stack development with Java. Focused on improving my fundamentals, building actual projects, and learning how to turn ideas into code.

This GitHub is where Iâ€™ll be documenting that journey â€” from basic practice to full-stack apps.
